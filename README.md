## Introduction

Dart and Flutter are powerful tools for building modern, cross-platform applications. Dart, a programming language developed by Google, is designed for client development and can be used to build web, server, and mobile applications. Flutter, also by Google, is a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

This 75-day challenge is structured to provide a deep dive into Dart and Flutter, covering everything from the basics to advanced topics, ensuring you gain practical skills and knowledge to build real-world applications.
