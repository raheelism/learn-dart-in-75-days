**Factorial Calculation**

**Objective:**

The objective of this problem is to develop a function or algorithm that computes the factorial of a given non-negative integer \( n \). The factorial of a number \( n \), denoted as \( n! \), is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \). By definition, the factorial of 0 is 1, i.e., \( 0! = 1 \).

**Input:**

- A non-negative integer \( n \).

**Output:**

- The factorial of \( n \), i.e., \( n! \).

**Constraints:**

- \( n \) must be a non-negative integer.
- The solution should handle large values of \( n \) efficiently, considering potential overflow issues in the chosen programming language.

**Example:**

- Input: \( n = 5 \)
- Output: \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \)

**Requirements:**

1. The solution should be implemented in a programming language of choice.
2. The function or algorithm should correctly compute the factorial for any valid input \( n \).
3. The solution should be efficient in terms of time and space complexity.
4. The function should handle edge cases, such as \( n = 0 \), correctly.

**Deliverables:**

- Source code or pseudocode for the factorial calculation function.
- A brief explanation of the approach and its efficiency.
- Test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation.
